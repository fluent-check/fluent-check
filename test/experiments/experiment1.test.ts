  /**
   * Summary of Findings:
   * --------------------
   * 
   * 1. The theoretical formula for miss probability P(miss D*) ≤ (1 - μ(D*)/|D|)^t 
   *    accurately predicts the empirical behavior with uniform sampling.
   * 
   * 2. As predicted by theory, we observed:
   *    - Small violation regions (0.1%) are frequently missed with few samples
   *    - Larger violation regions (5%) are almost never missed with 100+ samples
   *    - The miss rate decreases exponentially with sample count
   * 
   * 3. Statistical variation is significant and follows a binomial pattern:
   *    - Most variance occurs at mid-range probabilities (around 0.5)
   *    - Less variance at extreme probabilities (near 0 or 1)
   *    - For practical testing, this implies that we need tolerance proportional 
   *      to sqrt(p*(1-p)) when comparing empirical results to theory
   * 
   * 4. Important note on sampling strategies:
   *    - This experiment uses pure uniform sampling without any edge case bias
   *    - In contrast, FluentCheck's normal arbitraries typically include edge cases
   *      with higher probability, which is intentional for property testing but
   *      would invalidate the theoretical formula being tested here
   * 
   * Key implications for early stopping in property testing:
   * ------------------------------------------------------
   * - For properties with suspected rare violations (~1%), approximately 500 samples
   *   are needed to achieve >99% confidence of detection
   * - For properties with very rare violations (0.1% or less), exponentially more samples
   *   are needed (thousands), which justifies adaptive sampling strategies
   * - The formula provides a theoretical basis for computing how many samples are needed
   *   to reach a desired confidence level before stopping
