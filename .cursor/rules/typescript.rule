description: Rules for TypeScript code in fluent-check
patterns: ["**/*.ts"]
rules:
  - Maintain strong type safety. This is a type-focused project.
  - Follow the fluent API pattern that's used throughout the codebase.
  - Use descriptive variable names that express intent.
  - Prefer immutable data structures and functional programming patterns.
  - Maintain the chained type inference capabilities when modifying code.
  - Use TypeScript's advanced type features when appropriate (conditional types, mapped types, etc).
  - Export all public APIs with proper TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
  - Document complex type operations with comments explaining the intent.
