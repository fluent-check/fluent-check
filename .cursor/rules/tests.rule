description: Rules for test files in fluent-check
patterns: ["**/test/**/*.ts"]
rules:
  - Test files should demonstrate proper usage of the fluent-check API.
  - Tests should cover both positive cases and failure cases.
  - Include tests for edge cases and boundary values.
  - Use the chai assertion library consistently.
  - Maintain the structure of existing tests when adding new ones.
  - Structure tests to be clear examples of how to use the library.
  - Include comments explaining the purpose of complex test cases.
  - Prefer declarative test descriptions that explain what is being tested.
