description: Rules for Arbitrary implementations in fluent-check
patterns: ["**/arbitraries/*.ts"]
rules:
  - All Arbitrary implementations must extend the base Arbitrary class or implement the Arbitrary interface.
  - Arbitraries should handle edge cases appropriately (empty arrays, min/max values, etc).
  - Ensure proper shrinking behavior is implemented for each Arbitrary.
  - Maintain consistent statistical distribution characteristics.
  - Include appropriate type parameters and constraints.
  - Support method chaining for transformations (map, filter, etc).
  - Make sure that type information flows correctly through all transformations.
  - Document the behavior of complex arbitraries with examples.
