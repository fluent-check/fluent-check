description: Rules for main project files implementing core functionality
patterns: ["**/src/*.ts", "!**/src/notebook*.ts"]
rules:
  - Core files should maintain a clean and consistent API design.
  - Follow the fluent builder pattern consistently.
  - Ensure all public functions have appropriate TypeScript type definitions.
  - Keep complex implementations behind a simple, intuitive interface.
  - Use descriptive naming that aligns with property-based testing concepts.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance where possible.
