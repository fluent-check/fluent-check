description: Rules for FluentCheck testing strategies
patterns: ["**/strategies/*.ts"]
rules:
  - Strategies should follow the fluent API design pattern.
  - Ensure all strategies properly compose and can be chained.
  - Maintain proper type inference through all transformation stages.
  - Include proper statistical analysis and confidence calculations.
  - Support customization of test parameters (number of samples, etc).
  - Edge cases should be prioritized in test case generation.
  - Make behavior predictable and consistent across runs when using the same seed.
  - Strategies should be composable with different types of arbitraries.
