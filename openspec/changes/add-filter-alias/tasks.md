# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Core Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add `suchThat` method to `Arbitrary` base class
- [x] 1.2 Implement as direct alias to `filter` method
- [x] 1.3 Ensure same type signature as `filter`

## 2. Testing
- [x] 2.1 Add unit test verifying `suchThat` produces same results as `filter`
- [x] 2.2 Add test for type inference through `suchThat`
- [x] 2.3 Add test for chaining `suchThat` with other methods

## 3. Documentation
- [x] 3.1 Add JSDoc comment explaining `suchThat` is alias for `filter`
- [x] 3.2 Mention QuickCheck/ScalaCheck convention in docs
- [x] 3.3 Update API reference if exists
