## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existential Quantifier (exists)

The system SHALL provide an `exists(name, arbitrary)` method that binds a named variable to values generated by an arbitrary, asserting the property holds for at least one generated value.

#### Scenario: Existential property succeeds on witness
- **WHEN** an `exists` property is checked
- **AND** at least one value satisfies the property
- **THEN** the result SHALL indicate success
- **AND** the satisfying example SHALL be included in the result

#### Scenario: Existential property fails when no witness found
- **WHEN** an `exists` property is checked
- **AND** no generated value satisfies the property
- **THEN** the result SHALL indicate failure

#### Scenario: Witness shrinking
- **WHEN** an `exists` property finds a satisfying witness
- **THEN** the witness SHALL be shrunk to a minimal satisfying value
- **AND** the shrunk witness SHALL still satisfy the property

#### Scenario: First-class composition with forall
- **WHEN** `exists` and `forall` quantifiers are composed (e.g., `.exists('a').forall('b').then(...)`)
- **THEN** the composition SHALL be expressed naturally without requiring negation
- **AND** the witness SHALL be the exists-bound variable(s) that satisfy the forall condition

#### Scenario: Safety via configurable sample limits
- **WHEN** an `exists` property is checked with a sample size limit
- **THEN** the search SHALL terminate after the configured number of samples
- **AND** the result SHALL indicate exhausted if no witness was found within the limit
