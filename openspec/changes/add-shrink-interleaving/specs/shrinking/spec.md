## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tuple Shrinking

The system SHALL shrink tuple components using interleaved exploration across positions.

#### Scenario: Shrink tuple with interleaving
- **WHEN** a tuple [50, 100, 150] fails a property
- **THEN** shrink candidates are generated by round-robin through positions
- **AND** position 0, 1, and 2 candidates are interleaved fairly
- **AND** all positions have equal opportunity to find minimal value

#### Scenario: Shrink tuple
- **WHEN** a tuple [50, "hello", true] fails a property
- **THEN** each component is shrunk independently
- **AND** combinations of shrunk components are tested

### Requirement: Array Shrinking

The system SHALL shrink arrays by reducing both length and element values, with element shrinking using interleaved exploration.

#### Scenario: Shrink array length
- **WHEN** an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] fails a property
- **THEN** shorter arrays are tried

#### Scenario: Shrink array elements with interleaving
- **WHEN** an array [10, 20, 30] fails a property
- **THEN** element shrink candidates are interleaved across positions
- **AND** all element positions are explored fairly
